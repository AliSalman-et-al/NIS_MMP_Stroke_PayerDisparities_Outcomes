    "text": "This study evaluates payer-based differences in in-hospital outcomes, acute stroke intervention use, discharge destination, and resource utilization among U.S. adults hospitalized with stroke. We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS), 2017-2022, and conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis with design-based national inference.\n\n\nNIS is a stratified sample of U.S. community hospital discharges. We included adult (&gt;=18 years) hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). To reduce etiologic heterogeneity, traumatic hemorrhagic stroke presentations were excluded. Cohort construction and variable derivation were performed in a standardized preprocessing pipeline before analysis.\n\n\n\nThe primary exposure was expected primary payer status, with the main inferential comparison restricted to Medicaid versus private insurance. All payer categories were retained for descriptive analyses.\n\n\n\nPrimary outcomes were: - In-hospital mortality - Routine discharge to home and non-routine discharge - Length of stay (LOS) - Inflation-adjusted hospitalization cost (2022 U.S. dollars)\nSecondary outcomes included subtype-specific acute interventions (mechanical thrombectomy, IV thrombolysis, coiling/clipping, surgical evacuation) and post-acute destination endpoints (short-term hospital transfer as an IRF proxy, skilled nursing facility discharge, and home health care proxy).\n\n\n\nAdjusted models included demographic factors, socioeconomic markers, comorbidity burden, stroke-severity proxies, and hospital characteristics, along with admission year.\n\n\n\nAll analyses accounted for the NIS complex survey design (discharge weights, clustering, and stratification). We generated survey-weighted descriptive tables for baseline characteristics and outcomes. For inferential analyses, binary outcomes were modeled with survey-weighted logistic regression, and LOS/cost outcomes were modeled using survey-weighted Gamma generalized linear models with a log link, restricted to positive values. Prespecified subtype-specific models were fit for AIS, ICH, and SAH where clinically appropriate. Temporal trends were estimated using survey-weighted yearly rates, and effect modification by hospital teaching status and hospital location was assessed with interaction terms.\n\n\n\nSensitivity analyses included a working-age subgroup (18-64 years).\n\n\n\nBecause NIS discharge disposition categories do not directly encode all post-acute settings, IRF and home health care endpoints should be described as proxies in the manuscript."
